### Mana
The amount of magical power possessed solely by a single person.
 
### Total Spell Power
The total amount of magical power that a single spell can use, can be calculated by adding the caster(s) [[#Mana]] and the amount of [[#Sacrificial Gold]].

### Sacrificial Gold
Sacrificial Gold is gold that is designated to be destroyed by a given spell to achieve higher spell power. Sacrificial Gold is not common knowledge and is only known by a handful of casters.

### Spell Tier
Every spell can be ranked into a spell tier. This tier is used as a way to determine the range of [[#Total Spell Power]] required to complete a spell. Each tier requires exponentially more power to cast, however within a given tier the spell cost is fairly linear and only vary by a small amount. There is no limit to the amount of tiers, but there are a couple of important tiers:

- Tier 0: In this tier, most people who contain [[#Mana]] **can cast** these spells without any other help.
- Tier 1: In this tier, most people who contain [[#Mana]] **can not cast** these spells on their own and either require multiple [[#Casters]] to cast or need [[#Sacrificial Gold]] to augment their power.
- Tier $\infty$: These are spells that only end when it expends the [[#Casters]] [[#Total Spell Power]] or is interrupted in some way.
